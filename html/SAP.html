            <h2>My Career with SAP</h2>
            <p>
                I began my career in SAP directly out of college. This ERP technology was completely new to me. At first, I did not like it. However,
                after some time, I am happy that I ended up here. Throughout this process, I am learning more about
                business than I ever did in college, both from a functional side and technical side. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In my first role, I worked as a scrum master. We utilized agile and scrum methodology to deliver our development objects.
                These development objects are called RICEFWs. RICEFW is an acronymn for Reports, Interfaces, Conversions, Enhancements,
                Forms, and Workflows. We tracked all of these RICEFWs in a tracking tool called Azure DevOps. During the Explore phase in SAP Activate Methodology,
                 we discuss the local requirements with the regional team. During these conversations, the regional experts walk through the business process with the 
                consultants. The consultants refer to the SAP Best Practices and Business Driven Configuration Questionnaire
                to identify if the requirements are either a fit or a gap. A fit is a requirement which can be fulfilled
                by standard SAP functionality or by configuration. A gap is when the requirement is unable to be fulfilled
                with standard SAP. If that is the case, a RICEFW is required to fill the gap. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When I was in Explore phase for the first time, all of this was new to me. I did not have a tutor, so I had to ask questions
                and figure things out as I went on. I never expected anyone to hold my hand during my first year, but I knew that I did 
                not know very much about this way of working. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After Explore, we proceeded to
