        <h3>What is SAP?</h3>
        <p>
            SAP is one of the leading software vendors in world. The software they sell is 
            enterprise resource planning (ERP), which is business management software designed to 
            harmonize an organization's lines of business and streamline those transactions and processes
            into a centralized database. The database used by clients today is SAP HANA.

        <p>
            High Performance Analytical Applicance (HANA) is an in-memory, column-oriented database 
            designed for one thing....speed. Because the database is in memory, it utilizes Random Access Memory (RAM)
            to accomplish its tasks. In the past, databases were to be maintained on disk, which is much slower.
