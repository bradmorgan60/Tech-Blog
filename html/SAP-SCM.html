            <p>
                There are many definitions for what Supply Chain Management is...BUT it comes down to the same fundamental questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>How is an organization going to move their product(s) from point A to point B?</li>
                    <li>How is an organization going to source and procure the materials they need so they can assemble their products?</li>
                    <li>What are the transportation methods involved?</li>
                    
                </ul>
                Supply Chain Management (SCM) is a critical module in SAP S/4HANA.
                It consists of the network of retailers, distributors, transporters, plants, and suppliers who
                participate in the purchasing, production, storage, and transportation of a product.

                Supply Chain Management consists of the movement of a material / product from the point where it is produced
                all the way until it is consumed. This includes all of the processes that transform raw materials into final products.
